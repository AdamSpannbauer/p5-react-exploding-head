Planned to be a p5js + React mashup to create { < ~ ðŸ¤¯ ~ > }

App deployed [here](https://adamspannbauer.github.io/p5-react-exploding-head/).  The background of the application adjusts dynamically to the window width.  See [issues](https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/p5-react-exploding-head/issues) for future plans.
